class_name AdOffers
extends RefCounted
## When a timed rewarded-ad offer shows up on the HUD, and which one.
##
## Rules (numbers in Balance.OFFER_*): nothing in the first few minutes; one
## offer at a time; it goes away by itself after OFFER_LIFETIME; the clock only
## runs while you're actually playing (not in the catalogue or a popup); and
## every offer you let pass makes the next one wait longer. Taking one resets
## the wait. Offers only show when they'd be worth having (no "helpers 3x"
## without helpers, no 2x heat while it's already on).
