class_name Levels
extends RefCounted
## Level descriptions: the shape of each glacier and what's frozen inside it.
## There's one valley for now. A new level is a new dictionary like VALLEY.
##
## A level has one or more glaciers, melted in order: when one is gone, the
## next one opens up (the valley's village glacier, then the frozen lake).
## Each glacier is its own block of ice (IceField) with its own grid, shape
## and ice layers (Balance.LAYER_SETS). Its finds are Balance.DISCOVERIES
## entries with that glacier's index.
