class_name MonetizationProvider
extends Node
## The interface every ad / store backend implements.
##
## The game never talks to AdMob or Google Play Billing directly. It talks to
## the `Monetization` autoload, which owns exactly one provider. To ship real
## ads and purchases, write e.g. `AdMobBillingProvider extends MonetizationProvider`
## that wraps the plugins, and select it in monetization.gd. Nothing else changes.
##
## Contract: every request must end with exactly one result signal.

signal rewarded_completed(placement: String)              # player watched it: grant the reward
signal rewarded_failed(placement: String, reason: String) # no fill, closed early, offline...
signal interstitial_closed(placement: String)
signal purchase_succeeded(product_id: String)
signal purchase_failed(product_id: String, reason: String)
signal purchase_restored(product_id: String)             # one per owned non-consumable
signal restore_finished(found: int, error: String)        # once per restore_purchases()
