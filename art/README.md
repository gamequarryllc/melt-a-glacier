# Art sources

Everything here is made by script, so it can be changed and rebuilt rather than
hand-edited.

## 3D models (`art/blender/` -> `models/*.glb`)

Blender, driven from Python. `pip install bpy` gives Blender as a Python module
(Python 3.11; no Blender install needed), then run any build script:

    python art/blender/build_village.py      # house_0..4, church, well
    python art/blender/build_penguin.py      # penguin (Body, FlipperL/R, Foot)
    python art/blender/build_shed_props.py   # woodpile, barrel, lantern... round the shed
    python art/blender/build_pirates.py      # goblin pirate ships and crew frozen in the lake

`kit.py` is the shared modelling kit. It works in Godot coordinates (x right,
y up, -z forward) and on-screen sRGB colours, so numbers match the GDScript that
places the models. Godot imports the `.glb` files on its own; `scripts/models.gd`
loads them.

Style: chunky low-poly shapes with small bevels that catch the light, flat
colours (no textures), ink-dark wood trim, warm plaster, slate and copper.

House `i` is built for `HOUSES[i]` in `scripts/world.gd`: if a footprint
changes there, change `HOUSES` in `build_village.py` to match and rebuild.

## HUD (`art/ui/make_ui.py` -> `ui/*.png`)

Pillow draws the wooden plaque, paper sheet, painted-board buttons (cut
corners, no gloss), the hanging price tag, progress bar and round phone
buttons as nine-patch images. Grey parts are tinted in the game
(`UiTheme.enamel(color)`, `UiTheme.tag(color)`), so one image makes every
colour. It also draws the inked icons in `ui/icon/` (`UiTheme.icon("drop")`):
the HUD uses those instead of emoji, so add an icon there rather than typing
an emoji into a HUD string. `UiTheme.plain()` strips emoji from toasts and hints.

Fonts (SIL Open Font License, in `fonts/`): Lilita One for titles and
buttons, Nunito ExtraBold for everything else.

## Sound and music (`art/audio/` -> `audio/`)

numpy and scipy synthesize everything (`pip install numpy scipy`, plus ffmpeg
with libvorbis for the .ogg files). `synth.py` is the kit (oscillators, noise,
filters, plucked strings, bells, reverb, seamless loops); `make_sfx.py` builds
the sound effects and ambience, and `make_music.py` composes and plays the five
tunes on little synthesized instruments (felt piano, music box, kalimba,
celesta, flute, pad, plucked bass, pizzicato, shaker). The melodies and chords
are written out by hand in that file. See `audio/README.md` for the commands.

Style: cozy and a bit handmade. Wood, paper, bells and water rather than
whooshy "UI" sounds; the money is meltwater, so buying things glugs.
